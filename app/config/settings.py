This is a five days hack project made after a meniscus surgery ([buckethandle](http://www.leadingmd.com/patientEd/assets/buckethandle_tear.gif "buckethandle")).  
Being forced to rest and having some time to spare, I've tried to implement something useful to store and organize all the public knowledge around Google App Engine.  
I've coded this tool that is a sort of mix between a blogging platform and Delicious; what I dislike about delicious is that there is too much noise and duplicates in the tons of links bookmarked every day.  
What I dislike about blog platforms is that they lack a drill-down tag exploring feature a l√† delicious or Stack Overflow.  
I still have to think an easy way to collect all the data, I'm planning to code a smart bookmarklet that should help me in this task.  
This tool is a work in progress, so expect errors and other nasty things.
