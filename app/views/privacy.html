    <p align="justify">We do use cookies to store information, such as your
            personal preferences when you visit our site. This

        We also use third party advertisements on "At "$settings.HOST". Our
            advertising partners include 
          Google Adsense. Some
              of these advertisers may use technology such
            as cookies and web beacons when they
            advertise on our site, which will also send these
            advertisers information including your IP
            address, your
            ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and
            in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.
            This is generally used for geotargeting purposes
             or showing certain ads based
            on
          specific sites visited.

        <strong>DoubleClick DART cookies</strong>
      <br>
            

        <p align="justify">We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through
            Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie
            on your computer when you are browsing the web
            and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising
            (including some Google AdSense advertisements).
            This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you
            and your interests (”interest based targeting”).
            The ads served will be targeted based on your previous
            browsing history (For example, if you have been
            viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may
            see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing
            a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey).
            DART uses “non personally identifiable information”.
            It does NOT track personal information about you,
            such as your name, email address, physical address,
            telephone number, social security numbers, bank
            account numbers or credit card numbers. You can
