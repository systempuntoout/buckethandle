BucketHandle: lightweight CMS for tagging and collecting knowledge

I'm using the BucketHandle engine for GAE_cupboard project (http://gaecupboard.appspot.com)
but, when ready, I hope it could be helpful for some other project.

INSTALL:
Clone it 
Required library: webpy and markdown
Run it on Google App Engine.
